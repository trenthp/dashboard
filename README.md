Status Board
============

Why: A great app for larger displays. Can be set up really quickly for a wide range of needs. This can also be used more in depth for customized needs. The DIY panels can be changed off site and updated quickly. 



How: http://www.panic.com/statusboard/. You can opt for the easy graph or table which can be done in an excel spreadsheet, google doc, etc. that can be saved as a *.csv or go more in depth and make your own with html. There are easy enough instructions to follow: Graphs: http://www.panic.com/statusboard/docs/graph_tutorial.pdf Tables: http://www.panic.com/statusboard/docs/table_tutorial.pdf. 

The one that took me a bit longer to get worked out is the DIY panel: http://www.panic.com/statusboard/docs/diy_tutorial.pdf. This one takes a bit more to get figured out. It will not always look the same from browser to Status Board. There are a few guidlines that need to be followed, otherwise the html/css do not seem to match up. With a bit of tinkering this can all be figured out. From my code you can see what I did to get it to work out, but keep in mind, what you see in browser does not translate well into Status Board (it looks right in Status Board, but really lame in browser). 



Results: There are plenty of examples of things you can do with Status Board. Mine was meant to be used outside of a classroom with the information important to any student looking at the room. The biggest thing lacking from this would be a room number. I understand there are typically room numbers that would be used besides this board, but if that is a key peice of information, why would it not be included? This will be added for sure.
